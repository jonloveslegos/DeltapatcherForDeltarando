    # **Hook registration**: This entry point refers to a function
    # that will be invoked with no parameters. It must return a
    # sequence of strings, each element of which provides an
    # additional absolute path to search for hooks. This is equivalent
    # to passing the ``additional-hooks-dir`` `command-line option
    # <https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-bundle-where-to-search>`_
    # to PyInstaller for each string in the sequence.
    #
    # In this project, the function is ``get_hook_dirs``.
